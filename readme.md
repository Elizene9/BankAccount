To begin, run the application from the gradle window.

This will bring you to the front page of the application.

Here, you will choose whether you are the administrator or a user.

Administrators must login at the Administrators' password box using the password "password"

Users who are not currently registered can press register to register an account

Users who have been loaded into the app may login using their username and password

Once User account is created, the user may deposit or withdraw money from the account or view their balance

If a user wants to edit their account info like social security or email address, the administrator must edit this info which they may access from the administrator login page

An administrator may save the users to a .txt file after logging in using the save users button.

If the administrator exits the app and reopens it they may choose to enter users into the app using the load file button.

This allows the users' data and login info to be retrieved from a file created by the app instead of being manually entered

After this data is loaded from the .txt file, the users will be able to use that login info to access their accounts and withdraw and deposit as usual
